            <p>Hello! If you clicked on this site, most chances are, you want to understand what is happening to the word<br>

                <h3>The Gaza/Israel war.</h2>
            <p>This issue has been going on for a while. Two middle eastern countries fighting over religous land.<br>
                 This war has been going on since October 7, 2023, many people have since passed away.<br>
                Many children are in critical condition and some have passed away. The lack of food, water, and medical <br>
                care, are causing many people, including soldiers from both sides, to get very sick and leave the in very bad heath.<br>
            Right now, many people are supporting Israel over Hamas for no valid reason, donations on both sides don't help the government, they help<br>
        the people that ar injured and sick in these situations. Please, for the sake of humanity, donate not just to one side, but to both.</p>
